We need to convert it to GeoTIFF, the easiest way is using GDAL: gdal_translate -of GTiff input.grib2 output.tif Resample GEFS data available at 0.25deg ~ 27.75km/pixel spatial resolution While GPM IMERG available at 0.1deg ~ 11.1km/pixel. So we need to resample (250%) GEFS to match with IMERG using GDAL. gdal_translate -r bilinear -outsize 250% 250% input.tif output_resample.tif Clip the raster with Indonesia boundary Then we need to crop the GeoTIFF using Indonesia boundary.

WFP has clear operational requirements for the information provided by Climate and Remote Sensing Data Sets. Climate shocks are a major driver of food insecurity in the world and cause the majority of WFP beneficiaries. These data sets provide valuable information for: - Early Warning of food security shocks. - Contextual analysis required for planning of WFP interventions. - Climate Change adaptation programmes. As part of VAMPIRE development, WFP Indonesia try to use satellite-derived precipitation estimates to enhanced the rainfall monitoring module, so it\u2019s capable to monitor: - Extreme rainfall. - Rainfall overland-flow/runoff inundation. - Landslide caused by rainfall.","title":"Satellite-derived precipitation estimates and application"}]}
