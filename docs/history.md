# Revision History

| No | Date | Notes | 
| --- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 | 22 November 2016 | Brainstorming with Prof. Rizaldi[^1] |
| 2 | 21 December 2016 | Conceptual method, rainfall threshold value |
| 3 | 3 March 2017 | 3-days rainfall accumulation rolling daily using CHIRPS completed, ready for testing |
| 4 | 6 June 2017 | Rainfall threshold generated with help from Rogerio[^2] awk script |
| 5 | 8 October 2017 | GFS test, manual download using various method, THREDDS, OPENDAP and https |
| 6 | 23 December 2017 | Implemented in VAMPIRE as ArcGIS REST Services using GFS data as input |
| 7 | 8 January 2018 | Remove river flow and conditions, add limitation and constraints of the model |
| 8 | 2 February 2018 | Belitung case, Land susceptibility extraction |
| 9 | 25 February 2018 | Landslide flowchart |
| 10 | 19 March 2018 | Test for Ciwidey and Banjarnegara, but the rainfall in both areas below threshold, so itâ€™s better to remove the example |
| 11 | 3 April 2018 | First draft, ready for share |
| 12 | 6 June 2018 | Found historical flood extraction (HFO) using JRC GSW data via GEE, start processing for Indonesia by Year |
| 13 | 8 August 2018 | Mosaic HFO tiles from GEE and zonal statistics using CHIRPS and IMERG grid |
| 14 | 14 November 2018 | 1 district 1 equation for model maybe not suitable enough for Indonesia. Proposing to use watershed to Prof. Rizaldi |
| 15 | 21 February 2019 | BMKG criticized on CHIRPS performance as main input for flood module. Random check to above mentioned periods with other sat-based data |
| 16 | 13 March 2019 | Replicate the method using STATA done by Vira[^3], R approach will follow.
| 17 | 30 April 2019 | Finalized flow chart for the flood module, for sharing to PDC, C2S and DLR  |
| 18 | 3 September 2019 | Sharing the model update to VAM-HQ |
| 19 | 30 March 2020 | Update HFO Water History using latest data, re-processing by Month as more relevant |
| 20 | 1 May 2020 | Watershed for all Indonesia generated using ASTER GDEM 30, tested for max rainfall logit formula. Unfortunately not suitable |
| 21 | 18 June 2020 | Got feedback from Rogerio, try to test rolling sum 1 to 5 days |
| 22 | 25 June 2020 | Michael[^4] sent event data from AHA Centre ADInet, will test it for measuring alert quality |
| 23 | 30 June 2020 | Raster max and percentile using CHIRPS completed for 1 to 5 days period |
| 24 | 11 September 2020 | Focal linear regression between max rainfall and HFO, extract historical event from 1981 |
| 25 | 19 September 2020 | Found most of big flood event in 2020 not well captured using CHIRPS, lower rainfall value compared with BMKG station |
| 26 | 22 September 2020 | Start from all over again using IMERG Final and Late run to get rolling sum 1 to 5 days, max and threshold, focal linear regression and extracting historical event and calculate the likelihood to get final alert |
| 27 | 15 October 2020 | Documenting the process of extreme rainfall monitoring |
| 28 | 20 October 2020 | Jeffry[^5] completed flood event extraction from AHA Centre ADInet, will combine with data from BNPB and PUPR to validate the alert. Few approach has been tested, but the result still not perfect |
| 29 | 10 November 2020 | GEFS forecast data acquisition protocol |
| 30 | 6 December 2020 | Test GFS data process in EarthEngine |
| 31 | 23 Dec 2020 | Test IMERG data process in EarthEngine |
| 32 | 10 February 2021 | Combine GFS and IMERG into single process in GEE |
| 33 | 2 April 2021 | Check forecast for East Nusa Tenggara on tropical depression |
| 33 | 6 April 2021 | Result looks promising for both near-real time and forecast |
| 34 | 10 May 2021 | Refine GEE code, simplify some inefficient process |
| 35 | 25 June 2021 | GEE code review on population, crop and ruban area affected |
| 36 | 29 June 2021 | Technical documentation available at Github |
