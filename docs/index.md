# Extreme rainfall monitoring, will it trigger a flood?

## Welcome

Extreme Rainfall Monitoring (ERM) is a tool developed by the United Nations World Food Programme in Indonesia using [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com) (GEE). ERM are able to inform where is the estimated location of extreme rainfall and its impact to population and crop in the last 5-days and forecast up to 5-days ahead on selected date.

Some of the input is prepared via different platform: ArcGIS Pro, R Statistics, and Excel. ERM module is part of VAMPIRE [https://vampire.idn.wfp.org](https://vampire.idn.wfp.org) hazard features

This is the single-source of documentation for ERM. It is intended to be a thorough, living document detailing the background, objective, data, method and output of ERM. If you find a mistake, please open an issue.

ERM model developed by Benny Istanto and [Prof. Rizaldi Boer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=jTPXEp8AAAAJ) of Climatology Laboratory - [Bogor Agricultural University](https://ipb.ac.id) as Scientific Advisor.
